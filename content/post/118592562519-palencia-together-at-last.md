<p>We finally arrived at Palencia on Saturday night about 9:30pm. We found Pete and the hotel, checked in and went to get dinner. Though it was getting dark Palencia looks a very nice place. Off the tourist routes and the sort of place you wouldnt find unless you had a reason to be here. We were sat outside eating dinner and it was around 21Â°.</p>
