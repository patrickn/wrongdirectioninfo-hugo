<p>We all managed to meet up as planned at Portsmouth ferry port ready to board. Boarding was very quick and efficient, the bikes were strapped down with the help of the staff and we moved upstairs to to the bar.</p>

<p>After several lagers we sat down in the restaurant for dinner. The food was surprisingly good and we were served by a French speaking Australian named Blake.</p>

<p>Our first lesson was that when on a 24 hour ferry crossing, it’s probably not a good idea to head straight to the bar as soon as boarding. We hit the bar at 5pm and our best guess is that we finally left for bed at 3am.</p>

<p>Saturday we arose around lunch time in various states of health. Apart from watching the Dolphins the crossing was fairly calm and uneventful. Eventually we arrived in Santander, the unloading was not quite as efficient and seemed to take ages.</p>

<p>We took a slight detour towards Palencia and rode some really tight switchbacks and twisty roads. Temperature reached 22°C and dropped to 14°C at the highest point of 1100m.</p>
