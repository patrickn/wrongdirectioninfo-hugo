<p>Sunday 22 March was Adventure and Overland day at the <a href="http://www.ace-cafe-london.com/\">Ace Café</a>. We took the opportunity to arrange a meetup with the intention of doing some more planning. Well, the actual planning bit took all of 2 minutes, as we have a rough idea of where we are heading and want to remain as flexible as possible regarding the actual route. The remainder of the time was spent looking at all the bikes and perusing the stalls set up especially for the event.</p>

<p>4/5 of the team turned up, with Andrew away working in Holland somewhere. At 14:00 it was time to leave, and we ended the day by escorting a couple of bikes who were heading out on their own adventures, a couple off to South America two-up on what looked like a Honda post bike and a mate of Marks who was heading east around the world for the next three years.</p>
