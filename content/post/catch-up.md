<p>After finishing the HUMM, Team Wrong Direction has split up, Jeff has headed north back to Spain, Patrick, Mark and Pete have joined up with Gerry to form Team New Direction and are heading south.</p>

<p>We plan to visit the dunes at Erg Chebbi, Todra Gorge, Dades Gorge and maybe Marrakech before boarding the ferry back to Spain.</p>

<p>There won't be many more updates here, but you can still follow the adventure on the following links:</p>
