<p>After Brazatortas we continued heading south towards Ronda. The roads continue to be great but as we get nearer the coast the traffic increases, we passed storks nesting on chimney stacks and an ostrich farm. We stopped off in Ronda briefly to gaze across the amazing gorge, well worth a visit. After stopping for a brief lunch of ham, cheese and bread, we headed for Algeciras.</p>

<p>We didn't get to the ferry port until about 17:30 and after driving around looking for the ticket office we eventually managed to buy open ended returns to Tangier Med for &euro;81.</p>

<p>Once that was sorted we could think about a hotel. We managed to book two twin rooms in the Hotel Reina Cristina. It wasn't quite what we were used to but it would do. After check in we retired to the bar where we continued on our quest to rid Spain of all its lager. During the evening we bumped into two other bikers that had recently arrived from Morocco. Wolfgang and Ossi were travelling separately but gave us some good tips about where to go and what to see. They also mentioned that the temperature down south was about 47&deg; and it was very windy.</p>
