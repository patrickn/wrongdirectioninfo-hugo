They warned us if high winds and very high temperatures. After a hamburghesa and another beer we had a (relatively) early night to catch the ferry at 08:00 the next morning.</p>\n\n<p>After a circuit of Algeciras ferry port we eventually found the ferry to Tangier Med. Boarding was quite quick, and once the bikes were ‘securely’ tied with some thin rope to the handrail we went up to the deck.</p>\n\n<p>Before being allowed entry into Morocco we have to fill out immigration forms and have our passport stamped. This is carried out on the boat by one guy and a rubber stamp.</p>"
