<p>That’s it, it’s all over. Will Team Wrong Direction be back next year? Will we get a trophy? Will we manage to be up before midday tomorrow? Who knows. But we had an amazing time, saw some unbelievable stuff, and experienced something new. We were all, at times, out of our comfort zone and realised that our bikes and selves can be pushed a little further than we may have in the past.</p>

<p>Tomorrow Jeff splits the team to head back through Portugal, Mark, Pete and Patrick will be heading south to the sand dunes. We have already met with some other friends who will be travelling with is.</p>

<p>Wrong Direction HUMM 2015 is over, we haven’t had the final scores yet, maybe too pissed to update here until tomorrow so until then, au revoir.</p>
