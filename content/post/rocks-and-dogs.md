<p>On schedule we got our maps and started planning. We have a book of checkpoints that need to be transcribed to a map then we decide which to head for first. All the checkpoints are graded and have a point value, the furthest away being about 30km. We grouped them according to location and set off. We originally planned to stick to level 1 and 2 for the fist day, but due to either bad planning, luck or inexperience we actually ended up on some level 4 pistes (the highest being a level 4+). Well at least it can’t get much more difficult.</p>

<p>The higher level pistes are graded as such due to the very large rocks that litter the way. It’s not possible to ride around them, so you do end up hitting a few. It sometimes feels as though the bike is being shake to bits. We are actually riding around the national park and there are shepherds herding sheep and living along some of the tracks. Often they have a dog or two which enjoy chasing passing motorbikes.</p>

<p>We found all the checkpoints we set out for apart from 1 or 2, so I think we done ok. We did have a minor mechanical failure though due to a puncture which was soon mended and we were again on our way.</p>

<p>We have a better idea of what to expect tomorrow and we have already planned our route ready for an early start.</p>
